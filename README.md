Hello! ğŸ‘‹ I'm Lyes Djaout,

 A fullstack developer with a passion for creating web applications. Currently a student, I spend a lot of my time honing my development skills.

ğŸ”­ Currently, I'm working on various projects using my TypeScript and React skills to develop interactive, high-performance user interfaces.

ğŸŒ± I'm developing my backend skills by learning Symfony, in addition to my previous experience with JavaScript (Express) and Golang, to become a versatile developer.

ğŸ‘¯ I'm open to collaborating on interesting projects where I can put my skills into practice and learn new ones.

ğŸ’¬ Don't hesitate to ask me questions about my projects, favourite technologies or anything to do with web development.
